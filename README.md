# SWAPI API Details 
The Star Wars API, or "swapi" (Swah-pee) is the world's first quanitified and programmatically-accessible data source for all the data from the Star Wars canon universe!

We've taken all the rich contextual stuff from the universe and formatted into something easier to consume with software. Then we went and stuck an API on the front so you can access it all!

The Star Wars API is the world's first quantified and programmatically-formatted set of Star Wars data.

After hours of watching films and trawling through content online, we present to you all the People, Films, Species, Starships, Vehicles and Planets from Star Wars.

We've formatted this data in JSON and exposed it to you in a RESTish implementation that allows you to programmatically collect and measure the data.
